if cookie exists, and player isn't in active game, clear cookie


handle choices with 0 max options - this is an action by action thing
- bureaucrat, bandit or others with zero bank supplies

can i combine the throne room repeat + attack queing + council room queueing in one idea?

deal with some of the ui state with routing instead


problem combos i don't currently have
- gained cards don't immediately go to discard, breaks harbinger if there are gain actions? what about played actions? - vassal-harbinger - this was action dependent on nomads gain check for that combo though
- test artisan with no cards in hand? maybe only possible if you're gaining and immediately playing trail/berserker, and don't have a combo for that right now


changes
- choices screen
- more strict about actions, then buy


started game, 3 players join, add image, rebuild/refresh works, add more images, don't think it rebuilt? then refresh had "no playername" so showed the join screen
manual refresh lost playername for the play action but kept it for the refresh.... different components in Reac?
end game button on join screen does a page refresh instead of end call
something went wrong with berserker forcing discard and play of trail. might have drawn another trail, and then tried to immediately discard?
- was it a throne room -> berserker?




switch to a heartbeat for changes, then a refresh?

add validation on money to buys
