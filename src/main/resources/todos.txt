-on workshop, may or must gain card? eg, only copper?
? uncheck options by default
-mine "may" trash card
-militia appears to work if you only discard 1, probably 0 also

-make workshop single select - can only gain 1 card - ditto for remodel phase 1, phase 2

- timing of attack cards

- UI for weaver, moat

- play actions before money

- zero possible choices - remodel

- add "looking" tp choices

- three supply pile end game

if cookie exists, and player isn't in active game, clear cookie

-sentry peek didn't pull discard into deck

-cleanup should do nothing if open actions

-add card breakdown to end game json

- remodel with supplies at zero

handle choices with 0 max options - this is an action by action thing
- bureaucrat, bandit or others with zero bank supplies

can i combine the throne room repeat + attack queing + council room queueing in one idea?

add province cards for > 4players

did a refresh of JS, and the refresh/bank methods kept player name, but the play action lost it. second refresh also lost it on the join code

if the browser crashes, the cookie's lost....

gained cards don't immediately go to discard, breaks harbinger if there are gain actions? what about played actions? - vassal-harbinger - this was action dependent on nomads gain check for that combo though
artisan with no cards in hand? maybe only possible if you're gaining and immediately playing trail


changes
- choices screen
- more strict about actions, then buy


started game, 3 players join, add image, rebuild/refresh works, add more images, don't think it rebuilt? then refresh had "no playername" so showed the join screen
manual refresh lost playername for the play action but kept it for the refresh.... different components in Reac?
end game button on join screen does a page refresh instead of end call
something went wrong with berserker forcing discard and play of trail. might have drawn another trail, and then tried to immediately discard?
- was it a throne room -> berserker?
need to bring back popup for the end game points?
berserker didn't trigger attack for either other player - multiple attacks are sitting there
