# Dominion Api

Dominion is a deck-building strategy game. This project is a set of HTTP endpoints that could be used to maintain state and validate actions for a game of Dominion. I'm using it as a way to experiment with test frameworks - currently Cucumber, and in the future Citrus, and perhaps others.
